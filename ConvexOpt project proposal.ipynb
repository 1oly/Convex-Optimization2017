    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The generation of electricity from renewable energy sources is more important than ever following the global agreement signed by 195 countries at the COP21 climate conference in Paris, December 2015. The long term goal, to limit the global average temperature increase to 2$^{\\circ}$C, requires governments around the world to limit their dependence on fossil fuels and adapt renewable energy sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "This goal requires development and installation of more wind turbines (onshore and offshore) in the following years. Noise regulations on wind turbines near urban areas can restrict the installation of new wind turbines and limit the potential energy production. The main noise from wind turbines is aerodynamic and arises from turbulence caused by the air flow around the wind turbine blades in motion. The aerodynamic noise increases with the size of the wind turbine and with a demand for more productive, and thus larger wind turbines, there is an increased interest in quantifying the aerodynamic noise from wind turbine blades. In the design stage, wind turbine blades undergo a wealth of tests and simulations to ensure that the specific design is efficient. A wind tunnel is used to test the aerodynamic properties by applying a controlled airflow to a section of the blade. The wind tunnel can also be used to localize and quantify the noise sources with a microphone array, however, this requires specially designed wind tunnels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In typical experimental setups, a wind turbine wing section, i.e., airfoil, is placed in such a wind tunnel and a controlled air flow is applied. The aerodynamic noise generated on the airfoil can be measured with a microphone array."
